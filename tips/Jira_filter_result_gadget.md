### How to create Search Filter?

1) In JIRA go to **Choose Issues** > **Search for Issues**. The issue navigator is displayed.
If there are existing search criteria, click the **New filter** button to reset the search criteria.
If the Basic link is showing (in other words, you are in the **Advanced** searching mode), click Basic to switch search modes. This is what you should see:
