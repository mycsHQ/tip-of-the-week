# Three Golden Rules of Chess 🏅

## 1. Control the center
 Always be the first to control the 4 central squares of the board. Move your pieces directly
 to the center or so that they attack the center.
 
## 2. Develop your pieces
 Move the ♞ Knights and the ♝ Bishops outside of the first rank.
 The goal is to let them move freely and attack as many squares as possible. Especially the central squares (see Rule 1).

## 3. Protect the King
 [Castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castling) as soon as possible. The ♚ King is the most important piece on the board.
 Having the ♚ King safe in his castle will allow you to concentrate on attacking.

### 4. Create forks, pins and discovered attacks
The [Fork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(chess)), [Skewer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skewer_(chess)),
[Pin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pin_(chess)) and [Discovered Attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovered_attack)
are the tactic tools to achieve your strategic goals. Always try to create these attacks.

### 5. Attack the King
Remember that your first and foremost goal is to mate the ♚ King. Don't get distracted by "local conflicts",
trying to capture minor pieces or controlling the wrong side of the board. Keep checking and threating the ♚ King.
Trap him using the tactics from Rule 2.
