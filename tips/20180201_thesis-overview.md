# Bachelor thesis overview

This is a brief overview of the concepts and technologies used to implement the prototype of a manual viewer. The renderings - realised with [BabylonJS](https://www.babylonjs.com/) - use the renderings that are created by processing the assembly instructions. These instructions are formulated based on a newly developed DSL.
