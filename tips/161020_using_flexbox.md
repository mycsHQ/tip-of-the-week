and the space among them in a wrapping element. Especially when it comes to responsive Layouts you

```display: inline```, ```display: flex-box``` is more flexiable and thus it got its name. The idea behind 
```display: flex-box``` is, to give the wrapping element the ability to alter its children width, height 
and order to fill the available space most appropiate. It expands or shrinks it children and the wrapping space.
