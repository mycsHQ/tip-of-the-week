# Webtask.io

Webtask is super useful to quickly run an app or a script.
It creates an endpoint for you, you get an editor to modify the code.
This editor allows you to import most of the script from the npm registry.

The serverless framework now supports webtask, which means that you can very easily bootstrap your project and deploy it in a minute when you're already familiar with serverless.

Another cool feature from webtask is the slack bot.
After adding the webtask bot to your slack account, users will be able to create tasks inside slack and implement logic based on it (like a chess game).

mycs could use this to trigger deployments within slack.
