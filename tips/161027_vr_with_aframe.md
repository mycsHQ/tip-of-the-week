# VR on Webpages
[aframe-mycs-test](https://github.com/cremate991/aframe-mycs-test) Repo

[live demo](https://cremate991.github.io/aframe-mycs-test/) for that you can use e.g. the google cardboard

## [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/)
A web framework for building virtual reality experiences
With HTML and Entity-Component ecosystem. Works on Vive, Rift, desktop, mobile platforms.

For Basic implementation you only have to write HTML. You can find many examples on the A-Frame site or you use my `index.html`. It's a very simple example.

[A-Frame-Doc](https://aframe.io/docs/0.3.0/introduction/getting-started.html) has some normal geometries to use or you can create some own objects e.g. with Blender (the best way to use them is to export the model as .dae file).

Vizor is also a good option to make VR thinks but it is an online editor so no programming skills needed
