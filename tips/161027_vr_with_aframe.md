## [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/)
A web framework for building virtual reality experiences
With HTML and Entity-Component ecosystem. Works on Vive, Rift, desktop, mobile platforms.

For Basic implementation you only have to write HTML. You can find many examples on the A-Frame site or you use my `index.html`

[A-Frame-Doc](https://aframe.io/docs/0.3.0/introduction/getting-started.html) has some normal geometries to use or you can create
some own objects e.g. with Blender (the best way to use them is to export the model as .dae file)

## [Vizor](http://vizor.io/)
Vizor is also a good option to make VR thinks but it is an online editor so no programming skills needed
