# Using [Dash](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/dash-api-docs-snippets/id458034879?l=en&mt=12) to store and manage snippets

> Dash is an API Documentation Browser and Code Snippet Manager. Dash stores snippets of code and instantly searches offline documentation sets for 150+ APIs (for a full list, see below). You can even generate your own docsets or request docsets to be included.

Dash is great to manage Snippets that you have to use over and over again. You can categorise them by Tags and quickly search for them.
