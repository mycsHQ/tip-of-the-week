# How to test your unit tests: Mutation testing with Stryker 

### What's the mutation testing about?
100% tests coverage doesn't say that you tested all possible cases. To make sure that your unit tests are good and cover everything - you can use mutation testing: 

 1) Mutate source code to generate mutants
 2) Run the tests to see if they still pass
 3) Did any tests fail? The mutant has been killed!
 4) No tests failed? The mutant survived!
